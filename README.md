# SWU_Weather
This is a repository of the copy of my final project in June, 2020.

In this projct, I use Python spider to fetch the weather data from 中国天气网(http://www.weather.com.cn/), then use MySQL to connect csv files with Tableau.

You can find my Tableau settings in the Tableau file, which contains some simple visulation widgets and most of them are easy to read and understand.
